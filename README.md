# Trenuri-Romania

## Project Description
Our project is designed to help users find the shortest way from their desired destinations via railway.

## What sets us apart?
There's quite a feq websites that offer users the possibility to search for a way to get from point A to point B via railway. However, our app has two significant advantages over all of them:

### 1) The interactive map 
Our project gives the users the opportunity to play around with an interactive map of Romania, which helps give them a sense of direction regarding the places that they visit.

### 2) The accounts and the history feature
Our project also has an account system, where users need to be logged in in order to access the features our app provides. Using this, they can access their own search history and revisit their past searches.

## The User Interface
Our app's user interface consists of three different pages: login, signup and the homepage.

### Login and Signup
These two pages are similar, and their purpose is to let the user log in to our app. Below is a screenshot of our login page.

### Homepage
This is where users can make their searches with the help of our interface. The homepage contains the interactive map (left), and the user menu (right) ie the navbar with 3 buttons, the trip details form and the results shown below.
Here is a screenshot of how a normal trip search would go on our website:

Furthermore, if the user wishes to see a more detailed view of the trip, our app offers that possibility as well, with the 'Show detailed view' button. Here's how that looks:
